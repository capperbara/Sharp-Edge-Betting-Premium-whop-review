## Types of Sports Bets Covered

  

Sharp Edge Betting Premium covers the full spectrum of betting markets available in legal sports betting states. Here's what you can expect:

  

### Moneyline Bets

These straightforward bets require your chosen team to win outright without any point spread.

  

The service provides moneyline picks with analysis on why the underdog or favorite represents value.

  

### Point Spread Betting

Spread bets level the playing field between teams of different skill levels.

  

Sharp Edge analyzes how teams perform against the spread historically and in specific situations.

  

### Over/Under Totals

Total bets focus on the combined score of both teams rather than who wins.

  

The service examines factors like pace of play, weather conditions, and defensive matchups when making totals recommendations.

  

### Parlay Betting

Parlays combine multiple bets for higher payouts but require all selections to win.

  

Sharp Edge provides both smaller parlays for consistent action and larger parlays for potential big wins.

  

### Proposition Bets

Player props and game props offer specific betting markets beyond the basic game outcome.

  

These bets often provide the best value when you have detailed knowledge of player tendencies and game scripts.

  

### Futures Betting

Season-long bets like championship winners or player awards require long-term analysis.

  

Sharp Edge identifies value in futures markets before the betting public catches on.

  

### Live Betting

In-game betting allows you to place wagers while the action unfolds.

  

The service provides real-time analysis and recommendations as games develop.

  

### Teaser Bets

Teasers allow you to adjust point spreads in your favor across multiple games.

  

Sharp Edge explains when teasers provide value and which sports work best for teaser strategies.

**Serious recreational bettors** who want to improve their approach and results will find the most value.

  

**Bettors with established bankrolls** who can properly implement the unit sizing and money management strategies.

  

**People interested in learning** rather than just following picks blindly.

  

**Bettors in legal sports betting states** who have access to competitive odds and multiple sportsbooks.

  

### Who Might Want to Pass

  

**Complete beginners** might be better served starting with free educational resources first.

  

**Casual bettors** who only bet occasionally probably won't get enough value from a monthly subscription.

**Bettors expecting guaranteed profits** will be disappointed since no betting service can promise profits.

  

## Legal Considerations for Sports Betting

  

Before joining any sports betting service, you must understand the legal landscape in your jurisdiction.

  

Sports betting legality varies significantly across different states and countries.

  

### United States Legal Status

  

The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) previously made sports betting illegal in most states.

  

However, the Supreme Court struck down PASPA in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2018.

  

This landmark decision paved the way for individual states to legalize sports betting.

  

**Current legal status:**

-   37 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico have operational legal sports betting as of January 2024
-   30 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico allow online sports betting
-   8 states only permit betting through physical sportsbooks
-   North Carolina has legalized sports betting with operations beginning later in 2024

  

Since the PASPA decision, over $20 billion has been wagered on sports betting in the United States through May 2020.

## How Sharp Edge Betting Premium Compares to Alternatives

  

### vs. Free Betting Tips

  

Free tips on social media often lack the detailed analysis and accountability you get with premium services.

  

Sharp Edge provides transparent tracking and educational content that free services typically can't match.

  

### vs. Other Premium Services

  

The educational focus and community aspect differentiate Sharp Edge from pick-selling services that just provide selections.

**Ignoring the analysis** - Understanding why bets are made helps you learn.

  

**Expecting immediate profits** - Variance means short-term results can be misleading.
